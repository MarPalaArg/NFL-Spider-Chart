# NFL-Spider-Chart
A simple chart that describes how many sacks, interceptions, fumbles and penalties does a QB allows for the 2019/2020 NFL Season

The goal of this script is to make a spider chart that help NFL Fantasy players choose the correct QB for their team based on how many errors the QB made in the 2019/2020 Season. Also, if you are looking for how to make a spider chart and haven't figure it out this script will help you get started and even guide you to create your own specific spider chart. 

Hope you enjoy it.
